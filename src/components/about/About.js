        I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a Master's degree in Computer Science (EECS). I have 3 years of professional experience as a data scientist/ ML Engineer and 2 years of experience doing ML and DS research.
        <br /> <br />
        As a data scientist with experience in ML, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and robotic process automation (RPA), I excel at deploying ML models in both research and industry production settings. In addition, I am deeply committed to advancing diversity and inclusion within the tech industry, and I believe that machine learning and AI have the potential to make a significant impact in creating a more just and equitable society.
